        <strong>Details:</strong> As the nation celebrates 75 years of India's Independence, Deoghar College Deoghar in association with its knowledge partner Akhil Bhartiya Rashtriya Shaikshik Mahasangh (SKM University, Dumka) join hands to commemorate the glorious history of its people, culture and achievements based on the theme <strong>“Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav”</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The two-day seminar on Tribals of Jharkhand and Freedom Struggle of India
contributions of tribals or the indigenous people of Jharkhand to the freedom struggle of India. Their socio- economic backwardness, lack of mainstream political support and orality of cultural tradition prevented them from gaining due recognition. British newspapers and other contemporary writings have linked and restricted their uprisings to merely agrarian movements. The political and religious undertone of their movements were totally dismissed by the colonial regime.
Post-colonial Historians paid little attention to their various attempts of organized resistance to the encroachment of the outsiders on the tribal (adivasi) lands. History books are replete with the sagas of those upper-middle class western educated dominant Indians who struggled for India's freedom. But, there were also several class of people comprising of tribals, artisans, craftsmen, workers and others whose contributions to the national movement were either given a marginal space in history or remained unnoticed and unregistered.
    </p>
    <p>
    In the newly formed state what is now called Jharkhand, there had been many uprisings against the colonial policies and exploitations of moneylenders even before the Revolt of 1857, which the historians consider to be the First War of independence. Various tribal movements in Jharkhand that confounded the British rule manifested the charismatic leadership of Sido Murmu, Kanhu Murmu, Bhagirath Manjhi, Gyan Pargnait, Jatra Oraon, Birsa Munda,Tilka Manjhi and others, but they lay hidden from the world gaze.    
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <strong>Through this seminar we aim to explore the untold stories of the tribal leaders</strong> about whom we already know and bring to light various Tribal movements and unsung tribal heroes who sacrificed their lives for the country and without them the commemoration of 75 years of India's independence this year would be incomplete. As most of the Indians are unaware of the contributions of tribals to the freedom struggle of India, it is expedient to record their glorious role and contributions to the gaining of independence that will inspire the present youth and generations.    
    </p>
    <p>
        The tribals of Jharkhand fought against the onslaughts on their society and culture and tried to preserve its purity and sanctity.This aspect of tribal struggle during colonial era isfull of lessons and messages to the present generation as to how a community can protect and preserve its society and culture from alien attacks. We, therefore, intend to provide a common platform to the invited eminent resource persons, erudite scholars and academicians whose participation and deliberations would provide new ground for research and add to the knowledge of Indian History. This would also help to create awareness among the tribals and fill them with a sense of pride for their community's share in the contribution to the nation's struggle for independence.
